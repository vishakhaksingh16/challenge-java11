Checklist to ensure the application is production-and-support-ready.

1. Advanced Concurrency Control
- Optimistic Locking - Implement optimistic locking to handle scenarios where multiple transactions might affect the same account.
  - Example: Use a version field in the `Account` class and check it before committing changes.

2. Security Enhancements
- Sensitive Data Handling - Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
  - Example: Use libraries for encryption.
- Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access.
  - Example: Use Spring Security for managing authentication.

3. Robust Testing
- Integration Testing: Develop integration tests to ensure that components work together as expected.
  - Example: Use Spring Boot Test to create integration tests.

4. Code Quality Improvements
- Code Refactoring: Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.
  - Example: Extract complex logic into separate methods.
             Remove business logic from repository layer and implement in service layer.
             Use tools like SonarQube to analyse and reduce code complexity.

5. Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive Logging: Log all incoming API requests, successful operations, and exceptions with context (e.g., account IDs, transaction amounts).
- Exception Handling: Handle `IllegalArgumentException` and other exceptions gracefully. Return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
- Example:  Use try-catch blocks or use GlobalExceptionHandler , Spring AOP for logging

6. Documentation
- API Documentation: Provide comprehensive API documentation using Swagger or OpenAPI.
  - Example: Annotate controllers with Swagger annotations.
